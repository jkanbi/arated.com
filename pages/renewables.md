# What Are Renewables?

Renewable energy refers to energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. These sources are considered sustainable because they do not deplete over time and typically have a low or zero carbon footprint, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

## Types of Renewable Energy

- **Solar Energy:** Captured from sunlight using solar panels, which convert sunlight into electricity or heat.
- **Wind Energy:** Generated by wind turbines that convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity.
- **Hydropower (Hydroelectric):** Produced by harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water, often via dams or river turbines.
- **Biomass/Bioenergy:** Created from burning organic materials such as plants, wood, or agricultural waste to produce heat or electricity.
- **Geothermal Energy:** Extracted from the Earthâ€™s internal heat, used for electricity generation, heating, or cooling.
- **Marine Energy:** Includes tidal and wave energy, generated by harnessing the movement of ocean water.

## Why Are Renewables Important?

Renewable energy is crucial in the transition away from fossil fuels, which are major contributors to global carbon emissions. By shifting to renewables, we can help protect the environment, support energy security, and foster sustainable development.
